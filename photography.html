            I've always found photography as a form of escape. It is definately an art, a peaceful one. It brings me peace, whether 
            catching a sunset, capturing animals playing or simple gorgeous views in my home country, Bahrain. Having a camera with me everywhere i go
            helps me get those perfect shots, whether it be through my phone's camera or my handheld camera.

        <h1><i>Winters in Bahrain :</i></h1>
        <p> As you can already tell, our sunsets tend to look
            pretty during the winter and are much more detailed and eye catching,

            <h1><i>Summer In Azerbaijan </i></h1>
            <P>
                Last summer, I went on a trip to Azerbaijan with my family and it was well spent. Their views were breathtaking 
                although it would get too hot in the afternoons, However at night we were able to have amazing walks in their streets behind our hotel.<br>
                Furthermore, the shopping was great over there,  the most well known mall closeby to where we stayed was "The Ganjlik Mall, Baku". 
                The variety of shops they had there was great and the prices were affordable for everyone. Most of our time was spent looking around the place and 
                going for their amazing views. Azerbaijan is a country filled with beauty in every corner. Right behind our hotel was a nice park where we would take walks every 
                morning after breakfast to refresh and start our day with some nature. <br>
                Since we stayed at <u>The Four Seasons hotel in Baku</u>, everything was closeby to us, the villages, the museums as well as the malls is we felt like shopping. 
                Overall our trip was amazing and if we could go back there again one last time, we would without any hesitation.

            <h1><i>The Summer Sky</i></h1>
            <p>
                The sunsets in Azerbaijan were something else, the colors of the sky would look spectacular at around 6pm
                with the sun setting and the moon rising. The alignment of the clouds would be perfectly parallel at times
                when we would take walks at their parks, with the weather starting to shift to a cool breeze at night, although it was July
                it always felt like winter was coming.<br>
                I had taken my Canon 1200D camera to capture these amazing viewpoints and upload to my blog and it was the best decision ever
                as the resolution of the photos are so intricate and captured each detail of beauty there was to take.

              <h1><i>First Day Shots:</i></h1>
              <p>
                  The combination of pictures below are some captures of my first day in Azerbaijan, as we got into the taxi I could not hold myself 
                  back as their streets looked amazing and their street lamps looked like it was from the 90's with an antique style to it which made their 
                  roads look astonishing. In addition to that, All their buildings were made from perfect beige stones which add to the classic aesthetic of their country 
                  making it look overall stunning. There are not alot of modern day buildings in Baku, and thats what makes them stand out.
