                  These photos were taken by me and my friends during the holidays leading upto Bahrain's National day
                  which takes place on the 16th of december every year. Its the time where everyone celebrates our Independance Day by 
                  having fireworks at the Bahrain International circuit (BIC), where we also have concerts and races taking place every year
                  during the winter, right around March/April.

              electric cars that would be available to the market in 2019-2020. The car show displayed a range of beautifully designed 
              German-made cars, all so intricate with their interior and exterior designs that made all the guests fall inlove.

          <h1><i>My Never-ending love for Classic Cars</i></h1>
          <section>
            <p>
              The old American Muscle 1980's cars hold a big place in my heart. I've always loved these cars from the start, right when i knew a 
              thing or 2 about them. They look so breathtaking on the road and never run out of style! 
              For some reason, the way they were built back in the day allowed them to be great long-lasting cars that are still in use
              in this day and age, my uncle, for instance, loves his collection of classic cars and i'm always fascinated everytime i visit!
