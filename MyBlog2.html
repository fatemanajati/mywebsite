            <h1><i>Becoming a Modest & Beauty Influencer!</i></h1>
            <p>When I decided that I wanted to be an influencer, I started to have interests in different fields 
                of it, especially when it came to beauty, it fascinated me the most. I love to wear makeup, play with different colors and
                 create looks as well as teach my followers a few tricks and good products that 
                I've used for each unique look! My platform is what has given me the opportunity to display these
                skills and having an audience to share it with is the best part about it all.

            <h1><i>The Power Of Makeup</i></h1>
            <p>
                Beauty is something that we all have in our own unique way and makeup was made to enhance these beauty marks and not 
                hide them! That has been my biggest inspiration going into this. Sometimes in the industry, things can get a little
                out of hand, being that some influencers use makeup to make them a completely different person instead of using a little
                bit just to beautify their features. This has an adverse an impact on young girls because they are easily influenced
                by their favorite "idols" that they see or follow and will feel free to do the same, nonetheless it is absolutely not what parents want for their children
                 or what the beauty industry should be portrayed as.

              <h2><i>Yellow Sunshine</i></h2>
            <p>
                I usually tend to go towards the trends of what is new in the beauty world and try to create those looks
                and if not, add more to it if I have any creative ideas which makes it alot more fun for me! Ofcourse, this process takes time 
                and needs a stable hand and loads of patience, but the result always looks flawless in the end. The picture above is 
                one of my best-loved looks that I did a while back. This consisted of some light yellow and brown toned eyeshadows mixed with a little
                shimmer, topped with a white winged liner to complete the full look! </p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
                <h2><i>Cherry Pie</i></h2>
                <p>Another look I went for was a Red Cherry look which is my second favorite, I mixed together a few red and dark
                    pink shades to create this look, topped with a Cranberry colored lipstick, Since I was wearing a maroon top underneath
                    my jeans jacket, it matched the makeup look perfectly and got so many compliments about the color choice!</p>

                <div class="column">
                    <h2><i>Gypsy Queen</i></h2>
                <p>The third look has more of a "Gypsy Queen" vibe to it, It consists of a shimmery dark blue 
                    eyeshadow on my eyelids with a black winged eyeliner, followed by a simple nude color lipstick.
                This look can be for a simple night out, maybe a little extra on the eyes but overall toned down with the skin colored lipstick. </p>

        <h1><i>My "No Makeup" Makeup Looks:</i></h1>
        <section>
            <p>
                I love to play with makeup, but on some days I simply wouldnt have the energy or feel like sitting infront
                a my dressing table and taking the time to create a look. I've gotten used to doing my makeup quickly and efficiently whilst also
                making it last for the full day,
                especially when going to university when I have no time in the morning to keep alot of effort and time into it.
                Below are a few pictures of when I do a simple makeup look just to be presentable and neat.
