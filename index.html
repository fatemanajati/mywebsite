                        <h1><i>Get to know me:</i></h1>
                        <p>My name is Fatema Najati, I started my official blog account on Instagram right around September 2018.
                             That was the year I decided that I wanted to have a voice and an influence on young
                             girls that would be easily influenced by the unhealthy display of models and wrong lifestyles on social media, and I wanted
                             to be a difference that these girls seeked and one that I, myself, needed when I was once about their age.

                            <h1><i>My Growth Journey:</i></h1>
                            <p>
                                Starting off, it was a challenge. People would recognize my face when I would show up to certain festivals or events.
                                However, as time passed I got used to it and appreciated everyone that came up to me to say Hello. My account slowly grew around 1000 followers
                                by the end of that year and to this day, it holds upto 2.4K followers, which I am very proud of as I put alot of effort and time into growing it and
                                being a right influence as well as holding my standard high and being positive through it all. 
                                Let me just say, being "out there" is definately not for everyone. As a beginner in this industry, I've seen the positive 
                                as well as the negatives that it brings to one's way of life.

                            <p>
                                This step I took in 2018, was a big risk that I knew nothing about and simply went into it out of curiousity and 
                                the thought of what it would be like to have an "influence". Nevertheless, I wouldnt be here if it weren't for my parent's loving support and 
                                unconditional love from my friends and family. Their faith in me is what has helped me grow and love what I do today.

                        <h1><i>What I did to grow in a Healthy and Consistent way:</i></h1>
                        <p>
                             During the first few months, it was wierd and awkward to have my phone out with me always, capture things and post it up on my 
                            timeline. It felt as though the whole world was watching what I was doing and I felt like a complete weirdo doing it
                            in public. By time it started to get easy and I wouldnt care as much about what others would say or think, as long as it made
                            me happy, I would go for it. Thats the best part about being a full time blogger; you build confidence through these situations
                            and help others gain this confidence as well. Whenever I see young girls not have that much confidence or self-esteem 
                            in themselves, I would always tell them to do wahtever makes them happy, regardless if others like it or not (ofcourse, I mean
                            it within limits) and after that, they would be in their happiest and best form.

                                <b>I had to adapt to many things which were uncomfortable at first, However these are also a few steps that I learned as a beginner: </b>
                                <ul class ="a">
                                    <li> Being more "open" whilst also having my standards as a modest influencer.</li>
                                    <li> Taking photos of things I did more often.</li>
                                    <li> Keeping in touch with my fans/followers by being responsive and giving their views some attention as well.</li>
                                    <li> Posting consistently every 2-3 days rather than weekly posts.</li>
                                    <li> Accepting the hate and negativity (as not everyone will love what you do and that IS okay).</li>
                                    <li> TIP: always be yourself no matter what anyone says!</li>
